The past couple of days we were involved in the following activities:
- ran with the NIKE running club (10 km) and an urban running meetup group (6 x 1000 m on track)
- strolled around downtown Shanghai and in the French concession

- went to a cake shop
- planned our further destinations and bought 6 plane tickets
- made the blog available in English
- continued our online education
