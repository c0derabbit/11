We went out last night for a dinner in McDonalds. After that, we headed to the nearest convenience store for some beer and crisps. That was all… of course, we did inspect the selection thoroughly.

Beer is cheap and barely mediocre, on the other hand, it’s not really strong (2-3% alcohol, a 3,1% “stout” really caught our eye). Acceptable beers are usually imported (Japanese or western).

However, we found some interesting crisps (chips) flavours:

- grilled squid
- braised pork
- lemon fried chicken
- cucumber
- honey
- sea weed
- numb & spicy hot pot.
