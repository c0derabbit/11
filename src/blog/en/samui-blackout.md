title: Sorry, we had no Internet (nor electricity)

We didn’t have internet in the last three days, and there was no electricity for a day as well. The lack of internet was tolerable in the beginning, we were reading, swimming in the pool, training in the gym. But after three days it’s quite upsetting that we cannot study or even look up how to escape this island.

Times like these make us realize how important the internet is to us. We can get by without it, just as well as we can get by without shelter, clean water and heating. But it’s a fundamental human right and a basic necessity.

Of course we were told fairytales about when it would work again. A little breeze and a mizzle extended the crisis. You can’t possibly have internet when it’s raining, can you?

But this was not our worst experience in Thailand. One day we went to Chaweng beach (on foot, because we don’t ride scooters, taxis are expensive and there is no public transport), and after swimming in the sea, we wanted to wash the salt off our skin. We approached a lady at a counter with a big sign: INFORMATION. She greeted us with that suspicous fake friendliness (which we know too well), and after she realized the question, she said: *"I don’t know, it’s not my job. But you can ask those guy at the restaurant."* If we had wanted to buy something, her attitude would have been different.

We are writing this from the lobby of a hotel accross the street.
