Tomorrow we are going to Suzhou (it's 30 min by train from Shanghai) — we've been invited by a girl we met on the train on our way to Nanjing. We talked a lot (well, tried to), and she invited us to meet her family. She studies English at the university, which does not really help our communication. Anyway, we will smile and use the little Chinese we speak. 

### Words of the day:
乐高 LEGO － happy much  
宜家 IKEA － comfortable home  
可口可乐 Coca Cola － tasty entertaining  
苹果电脑 Apple － apple computer  
宝马 BMW － valuable horse   

### And two more:
雪花 — snow + flower = snowflake   
加油 — literally to add oil, for example when cooking. It is also used for cheering in sports, we learned it in the running club. :)

### As for the weather:
