All is well, we are just getting lost in all this smog.

The good thing is that we found a Decathlon store where you can try longboarding (and some other cool stuff too).

We found some interesting words on the back of a yoghurt pot:

酸奶 sour milk = yoghurt  
能量 ability quantity = energy  
蛋白质 egg white quality = protein  
脂肪 fat fat = fat (to make it obvious)  
碳水化合物 carbon water change together thing = carbohydrate

…and some that just follow latin origins (and German, sorry zinc):  
钠 [ná] = natrium (sodium)  
锌 [xīn] = zinc  
钙 [gài] = calcium  
钾 [jia] = kalium.
