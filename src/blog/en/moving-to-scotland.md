For a while weâ€™ve felt that we needed a calmer environment â€” so weâ€™ve left London for a small Scottish town. Itâ€™s a big change, and so far, a very positive one.

Londonâ€™s been good to us, but itâ€™s a hectic life, always on, with very limited opportunities to relax and recharge. [Read Samuâ€™s blog post on the good and bad](https://samu.space/etc/london/)!

### Hereâ€™s a recap of our London life:
- [We discovered the slightly better everydays of a first-world country](/en/london-first-week/)
- Weâ€™ve worked (and continue working) at [really cool workplaces](/en/working-in-london/)
- Weâ€™ve had some seriously [good food](/en/food-in-the-uk/), and boy, will we miss the variety and quality of food from all over the world in Soho, Shoreditch, and along the Regentâ€™s Canal!
- We managed to avoid [the tube](/en/london-tube/) in rush hours for the most part. But even walking to work can be stressful in such a buzzing city.
- There was [a tiny bit of winter](/en/snow/), two [lively bits of spring](/en/spring-in-london/), two really long and really hot summers, and the rest was filled with something that felt mostly like late October. But, despite the common notion, it doesnâ€™t rain a lot in London. In fact, on average, itâ€™s just like Budapest. 
- We had lovely visitors and went for some [pretty walks and museum visits](/en/london/).
- We made some friends, mostly at work â€” thanks for being awesome!

### Why Scotland?

We wanted to move somewhere colder (yes, seriously) calmer and closer to nature, but without the hassle of too much administration. Scotland fits the bill, and also offers some [excellent](/en/cairngorms/) [hiking](/en/glenmore/). Expect more hillwalking reports soon! ðŸ¥¾
