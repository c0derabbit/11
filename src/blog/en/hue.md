We arrived safe to warm and wet Vietnam. Naturally, we found the cheapest local bus from Hanoi airport to the city: it cost 8000 dong (less than $/€ 0.5).

To avoid the hordes of people, tourists and motorbikes, we travelled on to Hue. Food and drink is cheap and good, our shabby but spacious hotel room costs $10/night.

As far as we know, vietnamese dong is the second weakest currency on the planet. Our budget allows us to spend a million daily.

...and some Chinese linguistics for today: 越南 further south = Vietnam.
