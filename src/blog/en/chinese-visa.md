__We were born into a good world, where every requirement of free movement is readily available (political, technological, financial requirements), where our passport is valid for every country in the world by default.__

We were a bit disappointed about the apparent difficulty of getting a Chinese visa — of course, itʼs all relative. Compraing the EU, where we can travel even withouth a passport — it's a struggle.

At first we were told to __go away and bring more papers__ to the embassy. (We should bring papers about our employersʼ permit to leave. Or proof of our cease of employement. Or proof of lack thereof. Something. *“Just bring us some papers.”*)

Anyway, what do you want to do in Shanghai for a month? Whatʼs there thatʼs interesting? Itʼs a backwater, middle-of-nowhere insignificant place.

Itʼs true that we have overestimated our stay in China and we opted for the longest visa available. We thought we would try. It didnʼt succeed. 

### Plan B

The employee of “1000 Routes” travel agency told us it would be impossible to get a multiple-entry visa, if we donʼt already have the plane ticket for the second entry. We tought we might try anyway.

For our second attempt, the lady at the embassy was much less strict and was friendlier than on our first try, and we had more moderate wishes. Now we are in possession of a visa that is valid for a half year, for two entries, 30 days each. Perfect.
