Yesterday we’ve been to India! (Well, to Delhi Airport.)

It went like this:

- We walked 35 minutes in the 32 degree heat with 9 kg on our backs. We went to Bangrak pier in Ko Samui.
- We had been waiting for an hour when they told us our boat had been canceled due to lack of passengers.
- The boat trip took an hour and a half, and it was freezing inside, so we were chilling out on the deck. We were watching nearby islands go by.
- In Don Sak pier, we took a bus and endured a 10-hour long trip of torture. It consisted of freezing air-con temperatures, shitty and loud Hollywood movies and a constant eager to throw up.
- We arrived to the outskirts of Bangkok sometime after midnight. We took a cab (meaning, the bus left us on the side of the motorway and the bus driver hailed us a cab right there). This time it was blasting techno that entertained us all the way to the airport.
- At the airport, we had eight short ours to pass. The building was basically a deep-freezer, so we slept outside, on a concrete passageway. Laying still on our backs on the street felt like redemption at that time (but we wouldn’t recommend it to anybody).
- The flight from Bangkok to Delhi was nothing special, just plain awful.
- In Delhi, waiting in line was the main attraction.
- It takes 8 hours from Delhi to Milan. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is a cool plane, and Air India’s chicken tikka is yummy. However, the little Indian girl next to Samu was the epitome of the irritating passenger. She took this art to a whole new level.
- After having arrived to Milan, we bought some of the most essential foodstuff that we dreamt of the past weeks (cheese, apple, fresh bread, mineral water). Once again we passed the night on the floor, this time, on marble. It feels slightly cooler than concrete but it turns out it's equally uncomfortable.
- At dawn, we took a bus to Centrale, then a train to Verona.

We are in Europe now. More on that later!
